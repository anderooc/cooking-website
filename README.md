The main HTML Project is at commit: e2b05ad3cc9889fb4393678da65190ddf0ede6bc
HTML Files: homepage.html (main file), reasons.html, whatissteak.html, steakrecipe.html, steakcomments.html, whatareeggs.html, eggrecipe.html, eggcomments.html
HTML Focus Area: A more complex layout. I attempted a more complex layout by utilizing different backgrounds, and margins, splitting the website into a title, a main test area, and an area with an image.

The external style sheet is style.css at commit: 08d547e5209acd42d961eb5ccd5bab65875d8611
